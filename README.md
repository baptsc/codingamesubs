# Codingame submissions
This repository contains my solutions to programming challenges on Codingame (https://www.codingame.com/profile/6a40194d09662a48bd301cf10d005fe00117452).

Most of the challenges I solved so far are about graphs theory and pathfinding problems.

The solutions I push to this repository are passing all tests cases on codingame.

I use only C++ to solve challenges.

Note : since we must submit code in a single file on Codingame, the whole solution to a problem is contained in a main.cpp in this repository. Sometimes when multiple classes are necessary to solve a challenge, it can make the file difficult to read, I do apologize for that.
